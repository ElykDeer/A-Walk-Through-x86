This stage required no external server, as this is considered to fall into the category of reverse engineering problems reffered to as "crack-me's", which normally means that the flag is somehow creatively stored in the binary and there is some method by which the program recovers the flag, it is up to you to discover how the program recovers the flag and determine the right way to interact with the program such that the flag's recovery happens (or otherwise extract the mechanism and implement it better, for some challenges).

The flag that is printed by the program is stored in `../Part-1/Source-Files/flaggen.py`.

People solving the challenge should be provided with the same three files as the last part, located in `../Part-1/Challenge-Files`:
 `stage-1.asm`
 `stage-2.bin`
 `Makefile`

Description to be provided to people trying to solve the challenge:
```
Stage twooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!

This time the code that's important is compiled...
Can you figure out what's going wrong in stage-2.bin?
And more importantly, can you work your way around it???

(Same files as the last part)
```
